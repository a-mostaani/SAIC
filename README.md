# SAIC
Here I'm sharing the codes and numerical experiments related to an algorithm called SAIC. The algorithm is used for #task_oriented #data_compression.
The algorithm is published in an IEEE a peer-reviewed open-access scientific journal which can be found here:
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9916306/

I have included an extensive instruction to use the repository and its variety of functions in a separate readme file available in here in the form of a pdf.
